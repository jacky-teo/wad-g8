    <br />
    Audiophiles is a digital audio streaming and media provider, which gives users an immersive 3D audio and visual experience with all genres of music. It inherently allows users to upload and listen to music that they have created as well as from their own Spotify Playlists. 
    <br />
    The team would like users to relive the days of owning their own Hi-fi system where you could watch the movement of the music’s soundwaves, but in a manner where it's interactive and curated to their own music playlist.

According to Spotify, there is over 1,300 different music genres. While music genres continue to grow, the way that we listen to music has been less immersive. Today's act of listening to music does not involve much interaction or visualization as it did in the past with an old windows media player or a hi-fi system. Taking the concept of old audio visualisers, we have created a web application that allows users to interact with 3D visuals that move and change according to the varying beats and frequencies of the playing song. After further brainstorming, we decided to integrate Spotify into our application as it is a widely recognised music streaming platform. With Spotify integration and the option to upload their own mp3 files, the music that users can choose to play is endless.
